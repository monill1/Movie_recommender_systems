- building a content-based movie recommender system using cosine similarity involves collecting and preprocessing movie data, computing movie similarities, and building a recommendation system to suggest similar movies to users. This type of recommendation system can be useful for suggesting movies to users based on the characteristics of the movies themselves, rather than on the preferences of other users.
- This type of recommendation system uses techniques from natural language processing and information retrieval to analyze the content of movies and recommend movies that are similar in terms of certain features.
